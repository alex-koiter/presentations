# What is a riparian area?

- Transitional zone between the aquatic part (the waterfilled basin of the lake or wetland) and the surrounding terrestrial (or upland) area  [(Cows and Fish 2009)](https://cowsandfish.org/wp-content/uploads/LakesandWetlandsRHAWorkbook2020.pdf)
- "Wetter than dry” but “drier than wet” [(MB Ag)](https://www.manitoba.ca/water/groundwater/riparian_areas/index.html)
- The strip of moisture-loving vegetation growing along the edge of a natural water body [(Hilliard & Reedyk 2020)](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agriculture-and-environment/soil-and-land/riparian-area-management)

# Riparian functions
## Surface water managment
- Often cited as an effective means of reducing the loading of nutrients to surface waters
    - Nutrients, sediment, pathogens, and <br/>other pollutants are filtered by riparian <br/>soil and vegetation
- Slow runoff $\rightarrow$ reducing peak flows

## Surface water managment

# Riparian areas as filters
## Experimental (lab and field)
- Uniform flow of water
- Newly established
- Warm climate/temperature
- Rainfall

## Provides lots of good and <br/>important information but <br/>how well does it transfer to <br/>the prairie landscape?

# Riparian areas as filters
## Uniform flow of water?
- Only 1-2% of the length of the field-edge vegetation intercepts surface runoff
    - Convergence in the landscape results in concentrated <br/>flow paths
    - Most of the riparian areas are **NOT** filtering runoff
    - Variable width may help improve filtering with out <br/>putting land out of production

# Riparian areas as filters
## Warm climates and rainfall events
- Information on the efficacy of riparian areas in other locations may not be the same here
    - Snowmelt driven hydrology
    - Most of the time riparian areas <br/>are **NOT** filtering runoff

## Inter-annual variability
- Lots of variability between years
    - A few years can account for <br/>much of the total flow
    - Riparian areas are more <br/>important in some years but <br/>less so in others

# Riparian areas as filters

# Riparian areas as filters and sources

    - Harvest as a removal mechanism
    - Terrain can be difficult for equipment
- Riparian areas are more than just filters
    - Habitat, stream stabilization etc.

# Whats next?
## Challenges and opportunities
- Addressing water quality and quantity before it gets to the riparian area
    - Remember riparian areas are the last line of defense
    - Practices that promote efficient use of water and nutrients should remain a priority
    
## Easier said than done!

- Management practices to address one issue may have unintended consequences

---
# Whats next?
## Challenges and opportunities    
- The concepts of healthy soils and crops should be extended beyond the fence line
    - Farm doesn't end at the field edge
    - Need to balance other riparian functions

![:img center, bottom: 2%, 70%, ](./figs/IMG_20190907_100932.jpg)

- Indigenous leaders and community
- Engineers
- Hydrologists

## Challenges and opportunities
- If you have had good success, or challenges, with building, maintaining, and using riparian areas please come and chat with me
- It's a great way for me to:
    - Learn what others are doing (no need to reinvent the wheel, or make the same mistakes)
    - Explore the questions and directions research should be addressing
    - Make new collaborations

# Take home messages
- Multiple functions (more than just a filter)
- Cold climate & snowmelt driven hydrology
- Concentrated flow paths
