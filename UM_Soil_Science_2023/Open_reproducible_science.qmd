## Land acknowledgement

-   As soil scientists we focus on the health and function of soils
-   We work, learn, educate, and conduct research on traditional territories
-   The land, including the soil, we appreciate so much also includes the history of its people
-   Brandon University, and the surrounding area, are the traditional homelands of the Dakota, Anishinabek, Oji-Cree, Cree, Dene and Metis peoples

## Outline

### From field/lab to dissemination and everything in between!

## Definitions

### Reproducibility

-   Given the same data set the analyses can be reproduced

### Replicability

-   A separate investigator conducted an independent study and came to the same conclusion as the original study

## Reproducibility

-   Less about ensuring the correctness of the results
-   More about being transparent and understanding exactly what was done
    -   This is especially important in large and complex data sets

A study can be reproducible and still be wrong

## Open data and science

-   Making the data set, methods, and interpretation:
    -   Available
    -   Accessible
    -   Transparent
    -   Reproducible

:::

## Reproducibility

### Important because:

-   Allows us to evaluate the data, analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn
-   Allows you to revisit your own work (e.g., incorporate a suggestion)

### It is difficult to reproduce because:

-   Data is not made available/open
-   Method sections of papers often do not provide enough detail
-   Use of graphical programs (clicks and drop down menus)
-   Not making code available/open (R, Python, MATLAB)

## Working with large data sets

### Data aquisition

-   Documenting getting/downloading/importing data sets
    -   Always maintain the original data (unmodified)

### Example

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Downloading weather data for a few different station over many years
:::

## Working with large data sets

### Data munging/wrangling

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
1.  Formatting
2.  Merging
3.  Quality assurance
    -   NA's
    -   0's
    -   Detection limits
    -   Outliers
    -   Typos/errors

### Need to document every change you make

## Data analysis

### Analysis/figures

-   Data used
-   Analysis used (trial and error)
-   Parameters
-   Diagnostics
-   Figure creation process
-   Software versions

### Hard to write papers if you don't <br/>keep track of this!

## Open data and science

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Important because:

-   Improves global synthesis of knowledge
-   More robust and reliable science
-   Easier to build on existing work
-   Better collaboration
-   Improves collegiality
-   Promotes EDI
-   Community engagement
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### It is difficult to be open because:

-   Can be expensive
-   Can be time consuming
-   Lack the skills
-   Unsure of what might happen

## Sharing is caring `r icons::fontawesome("heart") |> icons::icon_style(fill = "red")`

### How to make your data open

-   Where to host it
-   When to make it available
-   Removing sensitive data
-   Format
-   For how long
-   Raw or summarized data
-   Attribution

### How to make your science open

-   Open access publications or preprints
-   Open peer review
-   Detailed methods
-   Open source software
-   Make code available
-   Make data available
-   Study preregistration

## Why is this not practiced?

::: incremental
1.  Don't know how
2.  Too busy
3.  It's internal work
4.  Worried about being copied/scooped
5.  Worried about exposing mistakes
6.  Rigged the data

:::

::: incremental
1.  Don't know how - **give it a try! lots of support and tools**
2.  Too busy - **often faster in the long run**
3.  It's internal work - **often a need to share**
4.  Worried about being copied/scooped - **in practice low risk**
5.  Worried about exposing mistakes - **happens to everyone**
6.  Rigged the data - **you have bigger problems**

    -   What, when, with what
-   Programmatically
    -   Scripts, R, Python, MATLAB, etc.

## Recent scuccess story

-   Collaborating with Ehsan Zarrinabadi on soil erosion project
-   Creating figures with a large data set

![](figs/Ehsan1.png)

## Recent scuccess story

-   Ehsan identifies an issue where a site has samples where % sand + % silt + % clay $\neq$ 100 %
    -   Data is nonsensical
-   Requests my help to resolve
-   Because Ehsan has a reproducible work flow (R script) he sends me the data and script

![](figs/Ehsan2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Recent scuccess story

-   Working with an AAFC collaborator (Dr. Sheng Li)
-   Asked to collect measurements and process the data
-   I wanted to have a reproducible data analysis work flow as a deliverable

![[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)](figs/Sheng1.png)

## Recent scuccess story

-   Loading in the data
    -   Formatting of the data was odd to accommodate field note taking

![](figs/Sheng2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Recent scuccess story

-   Calculations and output
    -   Very clear as to what was done

![](figs/Sheng3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Recent scuccess story

-   Reproducible
    -   Data

![](figs/Sheng4.png){fig-align="center"}

## Recent scuccess story

-   Reproducible
    -   Software versions

## Recent scuccess story

### Colour analysis

-   Worked on several projects where the colour of soil and sediment needed to be characterized
    -   Also collaborated on several projects with the same goal
-   Methods of analysis were well established in the literature
    -   Math was a bit complicated and used lots of data
    -   MATLAB script was available (not free)
-   Developed an R script

-   Got tired of emailing
    -   Posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/alex-koiter)
-   Changes are tracked through commits
-   Have added scripts to create figures
-   Most up to date version easily available
-   Has example data
-   Has an open copyright [license](https://github.com/alex-koiter/Colour-analysis/blob/main/LICENSE)
-   Has a [DOI](https://zenodo.org/record/5123327#.Y-VmxBzMKCg)
-   Easy for others to contribute via Pull requests
-   Can open issues (bugs)

## Ongoing scuccess story

### Wind erosion project

-   Remote sensing of soil surface properties
-   Involves lots of imagery and other large files
    -   Emailing not an option
-   Wanted a central repository for:
    -   Raw data (via Dropbox)
    -   Data analysis scripts (GitHub later?)
    -   Processed data (results)
    -   Publications
-   Good candidate to try out [OSF](https://osf.io)
-   Currently a private repository

## Closing thoughts

### Being reproducible and open make science stronger

-   One size does not fit all
    -   Lots of different approaches and challenges
-   It is not all or nothing
    -   Anything you do is **awesome** `r emo::ji("tada")`
-   It takes time and effort to learn and implement
    -   Everybody has a different workload and priorities
    -   Great support and resources are available
-   It can make you feel vulnerable
    -   Mistakes happen
    -   Can only be fixed if found
    -   This is not a sign of weakness - hiding or not learning from them is
