## Outline
### From field/lab to dissemination and everything in between!

## Definitions

### Reproducibility
- Given the same data set the analyses can be reproduced

### Replicability
- A separate investigator conducted an independent study and came to the same conclusion as the
original study

## Reproducibility

- Less about ensuring the correctness of the results
- More about being transparent and understanding exactly what was done
    - This is especially important in large and complex data sets

## Open data and science
- Making the data set, methods, and interpretation:
  - Available 
  - Accessible
  - Transparent
  - Reproducible

:::

## Computational reproducibility
### Important because:
- Allows us to evaluate the data, analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn
- Allows you to revisit your own work (e.g., incorporate a suggestion)

### It is difficult to reproduce because:
- Data is not made available/open
- Method sections of papers often do not provide enough detail
- Use of graphical programs (clicks and drop down menus)
- Not making code available/open (R, Python, MATLAB)

## Working with large data sets
### Data aquisition
- Documenting getting/downloading/importing data sets
    - Always maintain the original data (unmodified)

### Example
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Downloading weather data for a few different station over many years

## Working with large data sets
### Data munging/wrangling
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
1. Formatting
2. Merging
3. Quality assurance
    - NA's
    - 0's
    - Detection limits
    - Outliers
    - Typos/errors

### Need to document every change you make

## Data analysis
### Analysis/figures

- Data used
- Analysis used (trial and error)
- Parameters
- Diagnostics
- Figure creation process
- Software versions

### Hard to write papers if you don't <br/>keep track of this!

## Open data and science
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Important because:
- Improves global synthesis of knowledge
- More robust and reliable science
- Easier to build on existing work
- Better collaboration
- Improves collegiality
- Promotes EDI
- Community engagement
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### It is difficult to be open because:
- Can be expensive
- Can be time consuming
- Lack the skills 
- Unsure of what might happen
:::
::::

## Sharing is caring
### How to make your data open
- Where to host it
- When to make it available
- Removing sensitive data
- Format
- For how long
- Raw or summarized data
- Attribution

## Sharing is caring
### How to make your science open
- Open access publications or preprints
- Open peer review
- Detailed methods
- Open source software
- Make code available
- Make date available
- Study preregistration

## Why is this not practiced?
::: {.incremental}

1. Don't know how
2. Too busy
3. It's internal work
4. Worried about being copied
5. Worried about mistakes
6. Rigged the data

## Why is this not practiced?

::: {.incremental}
1. Don't know how - **learn! lots of support and tools**
2. Too busy - **often faster in the long run**
3. It's internal work - **often a need to share**
4. Worried about being copied - **in practice low risk**
5. Worried about mistakes - **happens to everyone**
6. Rigged the data - **you have bigger problems**

## Recent scuccess story

- Collaborating with Ehsan Zarrinabadi on soil erosion project
- Creating figures with a large data set

![](figs/Ehsan1.png)

## Recent scuccess story

- Ehsan identifies an issue where a site has samples where % sand + % silt + % clay $\neq$ 100 %
    - Data is nonsensical
- Requests my help to resolve
- Because Ehsan has a reproducible work flow (R script) he sends me the data and script

![](figs/Ehsan2.png){fig-align=center}

## Recent scuccess story
- Working with an AAFC collaborator (Dr. Sheng Li)
- Asked to collect measurements and processes the data
- I wanted to have a reproducible data analysis work flow as a deliverable 

![[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)](figs/Sheng1.png)

## Recent scuccess story
- Loading in the data
  - Formatting of the data was odd to accommodate field note taking
  
![](figs/Sheng2.png){fig-align=center}


## Recent scuccess story
- Calculations and output
  - Very clear as to what was done
  
![](figs/Sheng3.png){fig-align=center}

## Recent scuccess story
- Reproducible
  - Data

## Recent scuccess story
- Reproducible
  - Software versions

## How can you achieve this?
### Open data and science

- Open and free software

::: {.incremental}

- [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
- [Open Science framework](https://osf.io/)
- [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)
- Journal supplementary materials
- Check with your [library](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/oa-publishing)
- Include an allocation in funding applications to support this
- Look for training opportunities and support
- Encourage it, support it, and/or try it!

## Recent scuccess story

### Colour analysis 
- Worked on several projects where the colour of soil and sediment needed to be characterized
  - Also collaborated on several projects with the same goal
- Methods of analysis were well established in the literature
  - Math was a bit complicated and used lots of data
  - MATLAB script was available (not free)
- Developed an R script

## Recent scuccess story

### GitHub
- Was emailing the script to collaborators
- Got tired of emailing
  - Posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/alex-koiter)
- Changes are tracked through commits
- Have added scripts to create figures
- Most up to date version easily available
- Has example data
- Has a copyright [license](https://github.com/alex-koiter/Colour-analysis/blob/main/LICENSE)
- Has a [DOI](https://zenodo.org/record/5123327#.Y-VmxBzMKCg) 
- Easy for others to contribute via Pull requests
- Can open issues (bugs)

## Ongoing scuccess story
### Wind erosion project
- Remote sensing of soil surface properties
- Involves lots of imagery and other large files
    - Emailing not an option
- Wanted a central repository for:
  - Raw data
  - Data analysis scripts
  - Processed data (results)
  - Publications
- Good candidate to try out [OSF](https://osf.io)
- Currently a private repository

## Closing thoughts

### Being reproducible and open make science stronger

- One size does not fit all
  - Lots of different approaches and challenges
- It is not all or nothing
  - Anything you do is **awesome**
- It takes time and effort to learn and implement
  - Everybody has a different workload and priorities
  - Great support and resources are available
- It can make you feel vulnerable
  - Mistakes happen
  - Can only be fixed if found
  - This is not a sign of weakness - hiding or not learning from them is
