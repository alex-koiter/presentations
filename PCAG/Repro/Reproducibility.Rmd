# Introduction

## Reproducibility
- The data analysis can be successfully reproduced

## Replicability
- A separate investigator conducted an independent study and came to the same conclusion as the original study


---
class: split-40

# Reproducibility

- Less about ensuring the correctness of the results
- More about being transparent and understanding exactly what was done
    - This is especially important in large and complex datasets

# Computational reproducibility
## Important because:
- Allows us to evaluate the data, analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn
- Allows you to revisit your own work (e.g., incorporate a suggestion)

## It is difficult to reproduce because:
- Data is not made available
- Method sections of papers often do not provide enough detail
- Use of graphical programs (clicks and drop down menus)
- Not making code available (R, Python, MATLAB)

# Working with large data sets
## Data aquisition 
- Documenting getting/downloading/importing data sets
    - Always maintain the original data (unmodified)

# Working with large data sets 
## Data munging/wrangling   
1. Formatting
2. Merging
3. Quality assurance
    - NA's
    - 0's
    - Detection limits
    - Outliers
    - Typos/errors   
    
### Need to document every change you make
### Easy with small data sets with and simple structure

# Why is this not practiced?

- Don't know how - **learn! lots of support and tools available**
- Too busy - **often faster in the long run**
- It's internal work - **often a need to share**
- Worried about being copied - **in practice low risk**
- Rigged the data - **you have bigger problems**

# How can you achieve this?

## Keeping track
- Extensive notes
  - What, when, with what
- Programmatically
  - Scripts, R, Python, MATLAB, etc.
- Version control
  - git, [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
  
## Sharing
- Open Science!
  - [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), etc.
  - [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) (OSF)
- Journal Supplementary materials

# What do we use?

## git & GitHub

.columnl[
- **git** is a version control system
  - keeps tracks of changes
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com) is an online home for git projects
  - allows collaboration and sharing
- like R, tricky to learn, but oh so powerful!

# Making science stronger

- Peer review is difficult if we don't know how things were done
- Mistakes happen
    - Can only be fixed if found
    - This is not a sign of weakness - hiding or not learning from them is
- Reducing the need to reinvent the wheel for similar projects/analysis
    - Easier to build upon previous work
- Accessibility
