## Land acknowledgement

-   As environmental scientists we focus on the health and function of the environment
-   Agriculture is tied to colonialism and has contributed to the loss and degradation of land held by Indigenous peoples
-   We work, learn, educate, and conduct research on traditional territories
-   The land, including the soil, water, air, and plants and animals, we appreciate so much also includes the history of its people
-   Brandon University, and the surrounding area, are the traditional homelands of the Dakota, Anishinabek, Oji-Cree, Cree, Dene and Metis peoples

## Why Agriculture and Environment
- Agriculture is a major source of food, fibre, and fuel
- 7% of our total land area
    - 80% situated in the prairie region
- Cash receipts totalling more $90 billion [(Stats Can)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230228/dq230228d-eng.htm)

## Why Agriculture and Environment
- Environmental impacts [**on**]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} and [**from**]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} agriculture
    - Environmental conditions, risks, and changes resulting from agriculture and management practices [(Agri-environmental Indicators)](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/environment/indicators)

## Background

- Terms like [regenerative/sustainable agriculture]{.red} and [soil/plant health]{.red} are being used more frequently
    - Recognizes the importance and desire to view agriculture as more than the sum of its parts
    - Intersection of the four spheres


## My Approach

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Four interconnected spheres of the environment within the broader context of the many facets of agriculture
- Multi- and inter-disciplinary research team

Out of ~2,000 CRC's in the ['Find an Expert'](https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/index-eng.aspx) only 24 have agriculture listed as a keyword; 19 if only NSERC is considered
