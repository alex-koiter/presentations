## Land acknowledgement

-   As environmental scientists we focus on the health and function of the environment
-   We work, learn, educate, and conduct research on traditional territories
-   The land, including the soil, water, air, and plants and animals, we appreciate so much also includes the history of its people
-   Agriculture is tied to colonialism and has contributed to the loss and degradation of land held by Indigenous peoples
-   Brandon University, and the surrounding area, are the traditional homelands of the Dakota, Anishinabek, Oji-Cree, Cree, Dene and Metis peoples

## What is the problem?
- Globally, agriculture is a major source of food, fibre, and fuel
- ~35% of the global land area ([Ritchie & Roser, 2013](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use))
    - 7% of our total land area - 80% situated in the prairie region
    - Cash receipts totalling more $90 billion ([Stats Can, 2022](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230228/dq230228d-eng.htm))

## What is the problem?
- Can agriculture support 8 billion people (and growing)?

## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Principles
### 1. Research Excellence
- Creating an environment that brings together collaborators from across research disciplines and partners from various stakeholder groups
- Strong training plan will attract quality students
- Building additional research capacity through renovations and the acquisition of new analytical equipment
    
## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Principles
### 2. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
- Key part of my HQP training plan
- These are the foundations of a successful research group
    - Sharing of diverse views, opinions, ideas and experiences
    - Creates a culture of research excellence, innovation, and creativity


## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Principles
### 3. Responsible Conduct of Research

- Working within the principles of open and reproducible science promote research integrity


![The six core principles of Open Science; [Gallaher et al. 2020 Nat Ecol Evol](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1109-6)](figs/6_principles.png)
  
    
## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Principles
### 4. Transparency and impact
- Reach a wide audience
    - Kids (e.g., Enviro Expo, girl guides, 4H club)
    - Community activities (e.g., SMART Day, Open Farm Day, CROPS-A-PALOOZA)
    - Industry magazines, newsletters (e.g., Top Crop Manager, Grain News)
    - Social media (e.g., Twitter, Mastodon)
    - Media requests (e.g., Brandon Sun)

## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Principles
### 5. Indigenous Perspectives and Truth and Reconciliation
- Agriculture in the Prairie region, and elsewhere, is tied to colonialism
- Opportunities to reach out to local Indigenous communities and organizations (e.g., Waywayseecappo, Sioux Valley Dakota
nations)
    - Takes time to build meaningful and trusting relationships
    - Incorporating Indigenous perspectives into my research
    - Addressing concerns and exploring new ideas

## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Themes    
### 1. Climate, Environment, and Natural Resources 
- Agriculture is a contributor to climate change but also susceptible to climate change
- Agriculture has a large environmental footprint locally, nationally, and globally
- Soils and the plants it supports are natural resources

:::

## Brandon University Strategic Research Plan
#### Research Themes    
### 2. Biotechnology, Genomics, and Life Sciences
- Genetically modified plants may add to climate resiliency
- Lots of interest in biofuels as a carbon-friendly alternative

### 3. Rural, Indigenous, and Community Connected Engagement
- Agri-environmental issues can impact the well-being of rural and Indigenous communities
